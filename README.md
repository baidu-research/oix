# Open Information eXpression 

Open Information eXpression (OIX) is proposed as a methodology to highly adaptable Open Information Extraction systems [\[1\]](#reference). Instead of **Extraction**, it focuses on **eXpression**, that is, expressing all the information in the language into an intermediate structure so that one can extract various types of information for different applications from the intermediate structure. Open Information Annotation (OIA) is our implementation of the OIX methodology.  

## Open Information Annotation

Open Information Annotation (OIA)[\[2\]](#reference) is an implementation of Open Information eXpression (OIX). It expresses a sentence into a Predicate/Function-Arguments structure. 

### Standards

The OIA standard has evolved in two versions: 

* v 1.0: described in our EMNLP 2020 paper [\[1\]](#reference), with [annotation guideline](doc/annotation_guideline.pdf).
* v 1.1: described in our ACL 2022 paper [\[2\]](#reference), which extend the set of node types.  



## Data 

We construct our OIA data set (in standard v 1.1) as described in our ACL 2022 paper [2]. It can be found in the [data](data) folder. 

### Format 

See [OIA Data Format](doc/data_format.md) for details. 

### License/Copyright

The annotations and database rights of the OIA Dataset are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

You should have received a copy of the license along with this work. If not, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/.

The underlying texts come from where the sentences are from [English-EWT (version 2.4)](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2988) of the Universal Dependency Dataset.
