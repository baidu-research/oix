# Open Information eXpression 

introduction to open information extraction 

## Open Information Annotation

Open Information Annotation (OIA) is an implementation of Open Information eXpression (OIX). It is a language annotation on sentences. 

The OIA standard has evolved in two versions: 

* v 1.0: described in our EMNLP 2020 paper [\[1\]](#reference), with [annotation guideline](doc/annotation_guideline.pdf).
* v 1.1: described in our ACL 2022 paper [\[2\]](#reference), which extend the set of node types.  


## Data 

We construct our OIA data set (in standard v 1.1) as described in our ACL 2022 paper [2], where the sentences are from [English-EWT (version 2.4)](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2988) of the Uinversal Dependency Dataset. It can be found in the [data](data) folder. 

### Data Format

* The data  is serialized in jasonline format, with each line a sample. 

* Each sample has three fields: "meta", "words", and "oia".

    * The "meta" field contains the data source and the Uniform Resource Identifier(URI)

    * The "words" field contains the words in the sentence.

    * The "oia" field contains two list: "nodes" and "edges".
        - each node in "nodes" has two fields
            - the 'spans' field contains the context in the node, which could be
                - pre-defined predicate/function
                - the list of placeholders, additional (be) words, or start-end index pairs
            - 'type' field is the fine-grained node type
        - each edge in "edges" has three fields
            - start node index of the edge
            - end node index of the edge
            - the label of the edge
