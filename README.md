# Open Information eXpression 

introduction to open information extraction 

## Open Information Annotation

Open Information Annotation (OIA) is an implementation of Open Information eXpression (OIX). It is a language annotation on sentences. 

The OIA standard has evolved in two versions: 

* v 1.0: described in our EMNLP 2020 paper [\[1\]](#reference), with [annotation guideline](doc/annotation_guideline.pdf).
* v 1.1: described in our ACL 2022 paper [\[2\]](#reference), which extend the set of node types.  



## Data 

We construct our OIA data set (in standard v 1.1) as described in our ACL 2022 paper [2]. It can be found in the [data](data) folder. 

### Format 

See [OIA Data Format](doc/data_format.md) for details. 

### License/Copyright

The annotations and database rights of the OIA Dataset are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

You should have received a copy of the license along with this work. If not, see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/.

The underlying texts come from where the sentences are from [English-EWT (version 2.4)](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-2988) of the Uinversal Dependency Dataset
